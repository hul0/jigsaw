Description: intelligent password wordlist generator for offensive security
 JIGSAW (Joint Intelligence Generator for Strategic Attack Wordlists) is a
 high-performance, Rust-based intelligent wordlist generator designed for
 modern offensive security.
 .
 It moves beyond simple brute-force by employing probabilistic models,
 targeted personal profiling, and advanced permutation logic to generate
 high-value password candidates.
 .
 Features include:
  * Mask attack with Hashcat-style patterns
  * Markov chain probabilistic password generation
  * Personal attack using target profile JSON files
  * Memorable password generator with multiple styles
  * REST API server mode
  * Interactive CLI wizard
